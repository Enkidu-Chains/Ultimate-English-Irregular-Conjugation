## Languages for the manual

- [English](#english-manual)
- [Ukrainian](#ukrainian-manual)

## Description

In this deck, you will find and, most importantly, learn 183 English verbs with irregular conjugation patterns. Each verb has 3 notes for infinitive, past tense and past participle forms (except for the **to-be**, which has 6 notes).

Do the math and you will find out that there are 549 notes to learn but don't be afraid of the amount of notes, it only looks scary.

If you will do everything according to the manual belove, you will learn all the conjugations here in a month/month and a half, it depends on how well you will remember the conjugations.

All the notes in this deck are automatically made from the data in the [json file](static/Eng%20Irregular%20Verbs.json) by my [script](script.py).

The inspiration for this deck came from seeing the Ultimate Spanish Conjugation deck, here are several links to it: [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/638411848), [manual](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/boolbag/Anki-Goodies/tree/master/Decks/Spanish)

### Anatomy of a Flashcard

Here's how the card looks like

![Front Side](images/Front%20Side.png)

![Back Side](images/Back%20Side.png)

#### **The Prompt:**

The prompt is the front side of the card.

![The Prompt](images/The%20Prompt.png)

- The verb to conjugate appears `[...in brackets...]`
- Here the phrase `At that time,` and the back arrow `←` alert you that the tense to use is the *past tense*

Sometimes a greyed out fragment — here, `(the arm)` — is shown as a hint to give more sense to the phrase. *But the phrase doesn't have to make sense, the point is not to learn phrases but to conjugate the verb.*

#### **The Answer:**

The top part of the 'back' of the card shows the answer.

#### **Notes: Conjugation Part of Notes:**

Each card has such a part after the one above.

### How to Pace the Study?

At first, create new deck options for this deck and use these settings there:

Anki version > 2.1.46 (the option menu changed then)

- New cards per day: 30
- Maximum reviews per day: 200
- Learning steps: 2m 15m 1d 4d 10d
- Graduating interval: 30
- Easy interval: 4
- Insertion order: sequential
- Lapses: 15m 1 9999 Tag only
- Maximum answer seconds: 40
- Burying: both unchecked
- Advanced: 1826 2.50 1.30 1.00 1.20 0.00

Anki version < 2.1.46 (the option menu was different then)

- New cards: steps = 2 15 1440 5760 14400, order = new cards in order added, new cards/day = 30, graduating interval = 30, easy interval = 4, starting ease = 250%
- Reviews: maximum = 200, easy bonus = 130%, interval modifier = 100%, maximum interval = 1826
- Lapses: steps = 15, new interval = 0%, minimum interval = 1 day, leech threshold = 9999, leech action = tag only
- General: max answer time = 40 seconds, show answer timer

Anki will make everything automaticaly.

### Tags and Filtering

Although this is not how I recommend beginners use the deck, if you're an advanced student at times you may want to focus your study on a specific section of the deck. To do so, you can create filtered decks using the tags from [this file](List%20of%20Words%20and%20Tags.md).
